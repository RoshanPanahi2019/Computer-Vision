# Image segmentation for modular construction factories 

## Introduction:


## Literature review:

### Monocular construction progress monitoring:


### Monocular assembly progress monitoring: 


## Gap in research and the point of departure: 

Monocular construction progress monitoring has not been investigated in modular construction factories. 


To fill this gap, this research proposes two novel computer vision-based methods to automatically monitor the progress of assembly in modular construction factories. 

## Methodology:
The goal of the proposed method is to automatically monitor the progress of assembly on the production line in modular construction factory. 


## Case study: 



### 


### Image segmentation-based approach: 
The goal in this section is to locate the corner of the modular unit at a specific works station, using image segmentation. 


## Results:

Goal:
	- Achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on segmentation.
		- synthetic training.
		- integrate with BIM, hierarchical classification
	- Integrating this method with modular construction principles.
		- Looking at RFID papers in modular. 

TODO:
# The result is not good, even when tested on the training data
# Read about instance segmentation tips:
    # dataset size
    # perpective view 
    # model:
        # implement transformer-based segmentation.
        # hyper parameter tuning
        # using resnet 101
        # using other detection backbones: Yolo
        # using other segmentation methods with the same data
    # dataset:
        # increase the size of the dataset
        # Augmentation
        # VR dataset
        # undistort the images
        # using other techniques to increase the size of the dataset:
            # hand drawings
            # cad drawings
    #if results improved:
        # annotate from other views
